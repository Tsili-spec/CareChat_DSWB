SCENARIO 1: DIAGNOSIS EXPLANATION
================================================================================
QUESTION: "My doctor diagnosed me with Type 2 diabetes. I'm 52 years old, overweight, and my family has a history of diabetes. Can you explain what this means for me and what I need to do?"

LLAMA 3.3 70B RESPONSE (Score: 65/100):
"I'm here to help you understand your diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes is a condition where your body has trouble using insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Given your age, weight, and family history, it's not uncommon to develop this condition.

To manage your diabetes, you may need to:
* Monitor your blood sugar levels
* Make healthy food choices
* Exercise regularly
* Possibly take medication

The clinical context you provided doesn't directly relate to your diabetes diagnosis, as it mentions COVID-19 and malaria cases with elevated enzymes. These are separate conditions that require different treatments.

Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions. They will create a personalized plan to help you manage your diabetes and improve your overall health."

LLAMA 3.1 8B RESPONSE (Score: 80/100):
"I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes is a condition where your body doesn't use insulin properly, making it hard for glucose to enter your cells. This can lead to high blood sugar levels.

The good news is that Type 2 diabetes is often linked to lifestyle factors, such as being overweight, and a family history of the condition. This means that making healthy changes can help manage your diabetes.

Here are some key things to focus on:

* **Weight management**: Losing weight can help your body use insulin better. Aim for a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.
* **Healthy eating**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit sugary drinks and foods high in sugar and salt.
* **Regular exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, or a combination of both, per week.
* **Monitoring your blood sugar**: Work with your healthcare provider to set a target range for your blood sugar levels.

Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions. They will work with you to create a personalized plan to manage your diabetes."

GEMMA2 9B RESPONSE (Score: 80/100):
"It's understandable to feel overwhelmed after a diagnosis like Type 2 diabetes.

Here's a simplified explanation:

* **Type 2 diabetes** means your body has trouble using insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use sugar (glucose) for energy. When your body can't use insulin well, glucose builds up in your blood, which can lead to health problems over time.

* **Risk factors:** Being overweight, age (52), and having a family history of diabetes all increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

* **What to do:** Your doctor will likely recommend lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular exercise to help manage your blood sugar levels. They may also prescribe medication.

**Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions.** They can create a personalized plan based on your specific needs and answer any further questions you have."

SCENARIO 2: MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
QUESTION: "I was prescribed Lisinopril 10mg once daily for high blood pressure. How does this medication work, when should I take it, and what side effects should I watch for?"

LLAMA 3.3 70B RESPONSE (Score: 60/100):
"Lisinopril is a medication that helps lower high blood pressure. It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood.

To take Lisinopril effectively:
* Take 10mg once daily, as prescribed
* Try to take it at the same time every day

Common side effects to watch for:
* Dizziness
* Cough
* Fatigue

Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions."

LLAMA 3.1 8B RESPONSE (Score: 64/100):
"I'd be happy to help you understand your medication and the conditions mentioned in your clinical context.

**Lisinopril 10mg:**

Lisinopril is a medication that helps lower your blood pressure. It works by relaxing the blood vessels in your body, making it easier for your heart to pump blood. This helps reduce the pressure inside your blood vessels.

**When to take Lisinopril:**

Take Lisinopril once daily, at the same time each day. It's usually best to take it in the morning, with food and water.

**Common side effects to watch for:**

* Coughing
* Dizziness
* Fatigue (feeling tired)
* Headache
* Nausea (feeling queasy)

**Important note:**

Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions. If you experience any of these side effects or have concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to them.

**Your clinical context:**

The cases mentioned in your clinical context are not directly related to your medication, but they do mention high blood pressure readings. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a condition where the force of blood against your blood vessel walls is too high. This can lead to damage to your blood vessels, heart, and kidneys over time.

Please remember to follow up with your healthcare provider as scheduled and discuss any concerns or questions you may have."

GEMMA2 9B RESPONSE (Score: 65/100):
"It sounds like you're dealing with high blood pressure, which is when the force of your blood against your artery walls is too high.

Lisinopril helps lower blood pressure by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. You'll take 10mg once a day.

Some common side effects of Lisinopril can include:

* Dizziness
* Cough
* Fatigue

It's important to let your doctor know if you experience any of these side effects.

Please remember: **Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions.**"

================================================================================
QUESTION: "My cardiologist wants me to have an angioplasty procedure. I'm scared and don't understand what this involves. Can you explain the procedure, risks, and recovery?"

LLAMA 3.3 70B RESPONSE (Score: 73/100):
"I'm here to help you understand the angioplasty procedure. An angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure to open up blocked or narrowed arteries. Here's what you need to know:
* A small balloon is inserted through an artery to widen the blocked area.
* A stent may be placed to keep the artery open.
Risks and complications can include:
* Bleeding or bruising at the insertion site
* Reaction to the dye used during the procedure
Recovery is usually quick, with most people going home the same day. Your doctor will provide specific instructions.
Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions."

LLAMA 3.1 8B RESPONSE (Score: 75/100):
"I'm here to help you understand what to expect. An angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries in your heart. Here's a simplified overview:

**What happens during the procedure:**

* A small catheter (a thin tube) is inserted through a blood vessel in your leg or arm.
* A contrast dye is injected to highlight the arteries on an X-ray.
* A balloon is inflated to widen the narrowed area.
* A stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed to keep the artery open.

**Risks and complications:**

* Bleeding or bruising at the insertion site
* Allergic reactions to the contrast dye
* Damage to the artery or surrounding tissue
* Blood clots or stroke (rare)

**Recovery:**

* You'll likely stay in the hospital for a few hours or overnight.

Please refer to your healthcare provider for medical decisions. They can address any specific concerns you may have."

GEMMA2 9B RESPONSE (Score: 72/100):
"It's understandable to be scared about any medical procedure. Angioplasty is a common procedure to treat narrowed or blocked arteries in your heart.

Here's a simplified explanation:

* **The Procedure:** A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in your groin or arm and guided to your heart. A tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is inflated to widen the narrowed artery. Sometimes, a stent (a small, mesh tube) is also placed to keep the artery open.
* **Risks:** Like any surgery, angioplasty has some risks, such as bleeding, infection, or damage to the artery. Your doctor will discuss these risks with you in detail.
* **Recovery:** Most people recover well from angioplasty and can go home the same day or the next day. You'll likely need to rest for a few days and avoid strenuous activity for a couple of weeks.

**Please remember:** I'm not a doctor. This is just a general explanation. It's important to talk to your cardiologist about your specific situation, any concerns you have, and what to expect during and after the procedure."
