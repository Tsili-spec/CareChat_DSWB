# Project Architecture, Methods, and Tools

## 1. Architecture

This project follows a modern frontend architecture using React and Vite. The structure is component-based, with reusable UI elements organized under the `src/components` directory. State management and API interactions are handled via custom hooks in `src/hooks`. Styling is managed using Tailwind CSS and custom CSS files. The entry point is `src/main.tsx`, which bootstraps the application and renders the main `App` component. The project is configured for fast development and optimized builds using Vite, with TypeScript for type safety.

**Directory Overview:**
- `src/components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., Dashboard, AnalyticsDashboard, Forecasting)
- `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks for API and state management
- `src/assets/`: Static assets (e.g., images)
- `public/`: Public files served by Vite
- `index.html`: Main HTML template

## 2. Methods Used

- **Component-Based Development:** UI is split into modular, reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout the codebase to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **API Integration:** Custom hooks (e.g., `useApi.ts`) are used to fetch and manage data from backend services.
- **State Management:** Local component state and hooks are used for managing UI state.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and custom CSS files provide responsive and utility-first styling.
- **Testing:** Test files (e.g., `test-predictive.js`) are included for validating functionality.
- **Build Optimization:** Vite is used for fast development server and optimized production builds.

## 3. Tools Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript for type safety
- **Vite:** Build tool for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESLint:** Linting tool for code quality
- **PostCSS:** CSS processing tool
- **Vercel:** Deployment platform (configured via `vercel.json`)
