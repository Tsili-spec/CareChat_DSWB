AI-Enhanced Blood Bank Stock Monitoring and Forecasting System
Challenge description
This track aimed at developing and validating a real-time AI-enhanced monitoring dashboard that
enables DGH blood banks to track inventory levels accurately, forecast future demand, and optimise
stock management, thereby improving efficiency, reducing waste and shortages, and potentially
improving patient outcomes.
4.1 System integration and data ingestion layer
The foundation of this system lies in its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing hospital information
systems, particularly the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). The data pipeline must support
real-time ingestion of key variables, including donor demographics such as age, sex, occupation,
clinical data such as blood type, screening results, and operational metrics such as donation dates, stock
movements, and expiry dates. For secure, scalable, and reliable performance, participants can build this
layer using RESTful APIs developed with Java Spring Boot or Python FastAPI, ensuring compatibility
with other systems.
4.2 Forecasting and AI modelling framework
The forecasting engine predicts future blood demand based on clinical and operational indicators. This
module will combine classical time series techniques, such as Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using
Loess (STL) and ARIMA, with advanced machine learning models including XGBoost, Random
Forests, and Neural Networks built using libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
Feature engineering should be guided by exploratory data analysis and domain expertise, with
predictive variables such as blood type usage patterns, patient diagnoses, department needs, day-of-
week effects, and consumption trends. Variable selection methods like Lasso regression and feature
importance rankings from tree-based models can be used to prioritise inputs and optimise model
performance. All trained models should be deployed in an API accessible format to support integration
with the frontend dashboard.
4.3 Real time monitoring dashboard
This module involves building an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that allows blood bank staff and
hospital administrators to monitor inventory levels in real time. The dashboard should present stock
levels segmented by blood type and status, such as available, reserved, near expiry, and time to expiry,
using colour-coded visual indicators such as red for expired, green for good and yellow for new expiry.
The participants should use React.js to build a responsive and accessible interface and integrate visual
libraries like D3.js, Plotly, or Chart.js to create intuitive visualisations, including histograms, trend lines,
and shelf-life indicators. The dashboard should support data filtering by date, blood type, and location
and provide exportable reports for planning and audits.
4.4 Inventory optimisation
The inventory optimisation module synthesises forecasting outputs and real-time stock data to generate
recommendations for optimal ordering quantities. It should account for routine delivery cycles, safety
stock levels, wastage rates, and the cost implications of emergency replenishments. The goal is to enable
decision-makers to balance clinical preparedness and financial constraints. This module can be built
using linear programming or reinforcement learning frameworks, with optimisation models
implemented in Python using libraries such as PuLP or SciPy. It should generate dynamic suggestions
based on forecasted shortages, expiration risks, and usage trends, enabling proactive planning and
reducing last-minute stockouts.
4.5 Evaluation
An evaluation strategy must be implemented to ensure the system’s usability, accuracy, and relevance
to DGH’s operational workflows. Participants should conduct usability testing sessions with blood bank
staff using interactive prototypes, followed by structured feedback collection through surveys,
interviews, and walkthroughs.
5. Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of Datathon will be the successful development and deployment of a cost-
effective, multilingual patient feedback system, an LLM-powered patient support chatbot that enhances
patient education, improves understanding of diagnoses and therapeutic plans, and increases adherence
to treatment through accessible, personalised, and empathetic communication. A software application
that will enhance accuracy in forecasting blood demand using AI models.
